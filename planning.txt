Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs

# Subtasks

Create the divs using JavaScript.

It’s best to put your grid squares inside a “container” div. 
This div can be written in your HTML file.

Use Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid 
(versus just one on each line).

Be careful with borders and margins, 
as they can adjust the size of the squares!
